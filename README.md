# 🛒 Grocery Management System

A modern, responsive **Grocery Management System** built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, using the browser’s **Local Storage API** for persistent client-side data management.

This project demonstrates practical frontend development skills including component-based architecture, state management with React Hooks, UI design with Tailwind CSS, and data persistence without a backend server.
